# TWITTER-SENTIMENTAL-ANAYLSIS

##Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Problem Statement
In this project, we try to implement an NLP Twitter sentiment analysis model that helps to overcome the challenges of sentiment classification of tweets. We will be classifying the tweets into positive or negative sentiments. The necessary details regarding the dataset involving the Twitter sentiment analysis project are:

The dataset provided is the Sentiment140 Dataset which consists of 1,600,000 tweets that have been extracted using the Twitter API. The various columns present in this Twitter data are:

target: the polarity of the tweet (positive or negative)
ids: Unique id of the tweet
date: the date of the tweet
flag: It refers to the query. If no such query exists, then it is NO QUERY.
user: It refers to the name of the user that tweeted
text: It refers to the text of the tweet

## Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Project Pipeline
The various steps involved in the Machine Learning Pipeline are:

Import Necessary Dependencies
Read and Load the Dataset
Exploratory Data Analysis
Data Visualization of Target Variables
Data Preprocessing
Splitting our data into Train and Test sets.
Transforming Dataset using TF-IDF Vectorizer
Function for Model Evaluation
Model Building
Model Evaluation

### Key Takeaways

Twitter Sentimental Analysis is used to identify as well as classify the sentiments that are expressed in the text source.
Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes are some of the ML algorithms that can be used for Twitter Sentimental Analysis.
